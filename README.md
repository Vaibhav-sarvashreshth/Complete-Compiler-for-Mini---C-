# Complete-Compiler-for-Mini---C-
This project is a compiler for a mini C language that can parse, analyze, and generate code for a subset of the C programming language.

# Technologies Used
The compiler is being built in [insert programming language], with the [insert libraries, frameworks, or tools] being used for parsing, lexing, and code generation.

# Features
The compiler currently supports the following features of the mini C language:

# Arithmetic operations
Variable declaration and assignment
Control flow statements (if/else, while loops)
Functions with parameters and return values
Arrays

# Limitations
The mini C language being compiled has a number of restrictions compared to full C, including:

No support for pointers
No support for structs or unions
Limited data types (integers only)
No support for dynamic memory allocation

# Scope
This project aims to provide a basic understanding of how compilers work by implementing a simple, yet functional, compiler for a subset of the C programming language. The focus is on parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation, rather than advanced optimization techniques.
